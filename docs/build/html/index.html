<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p><strong>Follow Official Instructions</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Crypto.com will never ask for your password, private keys, or full credit/debit card details. Be cautious and don’t share sensitive information with anyone pretending to be a support agent.</p>
